## Introduction
This is an extended work of the github improved version of [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA), named [Towards Fast, Accurate and Stable 3D Dense Face Alignment](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162.pdf), accepted by [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/). The supplementary material is [here](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162-supp.pdf).

**The code and models will be released in next days.** üòÉ

## Get Started
1. Clone this repo
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2.git
cd 3DDFA_V2
```

2. Build Cython version of NMS 
```shell script
cd FaceBoxes
sh ./build_cpu_nms.sh
```

3. Run demos

```shell script
# running on still image
python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg

# running on videos
python3 demo_video.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi

# running on videos smoothly by looking ahead by `n_next` frames
python3 demo_video_smooth.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi
```

The implementation of tracking is simply by alignment. If the head pose > 90¬∞ or the motion is too fast, the alignment may fail. I use a threshold to trickly check the tracking state, but it is unstable.
